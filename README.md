🌱 Plant Disease Detection using CNN & Flask

A deep learning–based web application that identifies plant leaf diseases from images.
Built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with a Flask web interface, this system allows users to upload a leaf image and instantly receive a disease prediction result.

🔧 Tech Stack

Python

TensorFlow / Keras (CNN model)

Flask (Web Framework)

OpenCV & NumPy

HTML / CSS / JS (Frontend)

🚀 Features

Upload a plant leaf image directly from the browser

Automatic preprocessing & prediction using trained CNN

Real-time classification output

Supports multiple leaf disease categories (e.g., Healthy, Rust, Powdery Mildew)

Simple and lightweight local server deployment

🧠 Model

Trained on plant disease dataset with multiple leaf classes

Uses CNN architecture with max-pooling & dense classification layers

Model saved as model.h5 for fast inference

🎯 Purpose

This project helps farmers, students, and researchers quickly detect plant diseases early to support proper treatment and increase crop health.
